### Step 4: Review the Code
- **Flask Setup**: The Flask app is initialized with a secret key for session management.
- **Routes**:
  - The `/` route renders the `index.html` template.
  - The `/upload` route handles file uploads, validates the file type, and saves the file to the `uploads` directory.
- **File Upload Handling**:
  - The `allowed_file` function ensures only `.txt` files are accepted.
  - Uploaded files are saved securely using `secure_filename`.
  - Flash messages provide feedback to the user.
- **Conventions**: The code adheres to Flask conventions and includes necessary imports and configurations.
